                        Hashing is the transformation of a string of characters into a usually shorter fixed-length value or key that represents the original string. Hashing is used to index and retrieve items in a database because it is faster to find the item using the shorter hashed key than to find it using the original value. It is also used in many encryption algorithms. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function" target="blank">Wikipedia Link</a>

                        A hash function usually returns a hexadecimal value. Here in <b>Word Hashing</b> the function returns a set of 4 English words instead of a seemingly arbitrary set of characters. These words are selected by the program from a huge database of words using an existing hashing algorithm. This algorithm was developed with a view of creating an easy understanding about hashing. Thus, it has no literal application so far.

                        <b>Word Hashing</b> uses a huge database of english words, each associated with a hexadecimal value. When a user inputs a value, the string is sent to the server as an asynchronous request. This value is then hashed using an existing SHA1 hashing algorithm. This hash value is then broken down into "sub hashes", which are used as keys to the associated words in the database.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The application uses PHP for the "hash requests" functionality and JavaScript to handle them. Moreover HTML and CSS is used for designing.

                        Please note that the word database consists of over 500,000 words. These words were filtered to remove profanity at the time of development. However, there is always a chance, although highly unlikely that you are displayed an "Internet Banned" word.
